It's best to use quicklisp for loading the project as it will install any
dependencies needed and it makes setup a snap.

First, push the project's directory to the asdf central registry. This will
make quicklisp aware of it.

(push #p"~/Projects/the-pez-dispenser/" asdf:*central-registry*)

Now you can load the project at the REPL with quicklisp:

(ql:quickload "tracer")

And you're good to go.
